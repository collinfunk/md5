Implementation of the MD5 message-digest algorithm tested against the strings
shown in RFC 1321.

If your system's byte order is little-endian you can #define MD5_LITTLE_ENDIAN
to use memcpy to convert 64-byte blocks into 32-bit words for md5_transform.
Clang seems to produce the same assembly with just -O3 whether or not memcpy
is used, but it might be faster on other optimization settings :D.
